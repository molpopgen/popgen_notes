    "At about 11mya, this position changed from `T` to `A` on the branch leading from `H/C/G` to Gorilla.\n",
    "The result is that most or all individuals that are modern gorillas will have an `A` at position 800.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write down the logic required to figure out how to determine the DNA sequence at a specific position for our tip nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the `derived` state of the change. (`A` at position 800.)\n",
    "2. Identify the `branch` that the mutation occurs on. (The `H/C/G` to Gorilla branch for this mutation.)\n",
    "3. Trace from the mutation down to each tree tip, making sure to follow all branching points along the way. This step is easy for position 800 -- there is only one branch all the way down to the Gorilla tip node.  The derived state is present in all of the tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Position 800 is not very interesting, but position 42 is!\n",
    "Let's perform our steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The derived state of this mutation is `C`.\n",
    "2. It occurs on the `H/C/G` to `H/C` branch.\n",
    "3. Tracing down the tree to the present day, we find that the tips are Human and Chimp. Therefore, human and chimp *both* have a `C` at position 42 of the genome!"

For example, at position 42, we have a mutation from `T` to `C` about 7 million years ago and then another from `C` to `T` about 0.5 million years ago on the branch leading to chimpanzees.  The result of this chain of events is that humans have a `C` at this position yet the chimp has a `T` because the second \"hit\" reverted the DNA sequence back to the original ancestral state (`T`).\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trees are graphs that describe the relationship among the tip nodes.\n",
    "2. In biology, the tips of trees represent things that we study -- extant species, individuals sampled from modern populations, etc..\n",
    "   1. Tips need not be associated with the present time. We are now able to sequence DNA from preserved samples.  For example, we have genome sequences from extinct species like the wooly mammoth and the Neanderthal.\n",
    "4. The ancestral (non-tip) nodes are the ancestors of the tips, meaning that they existed in the past.\n",
    "5. Branch lengths usually indicate \"how much evolution\" has occurred on the branch. The examples in this section are in units of time.\n",
    "6. We can trace changes on the trees from the past to the present.  These changes tell us the \"state\" of the tips. The examples here all trace changes in DNA sequence from the past to the present."
