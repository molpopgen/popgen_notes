              in population genetics, and with improving methods and data, ever
              more complex models are being proposed and tested. Demographic
              models of current interest typically consist of a set of discrete
              populations, their sizes and growth rates, and continuous and
              pulse migrations between those populations over a number of
              epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully describe.
              There is currently no standard format to define such models,
              significantly hampering progress in the field. In particular, the
              important task of translating the model descriptions in published
              work into input suitable for population genetic simulators is
              labor intensive and error prone. We propose the Demes data model
              and file format, built on widely used technologies, to alleviate
              these issues. Demes provide a well-defined and unambiguous model
              of populations and their properties that is straightforward to
              implement in software, and a text file format that is designed for
              simplicity and clarity. We provide thoroughly tested
              implementations of Demes parsers in multiple languages including
              Python and C, and showcase initial support in several simulators
              and inference methods. An introduction to the file format and a
              detailed specification are available at
              https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-spec-docs/.",

               is a central goal of population genetics. Classical models for
               the distribution of allele frequencies, using forward simulation,
               coalescent theory, or the diffusion approximation, have been
               applied extensively for demographic inference, medical study
               design, and evolutionary studies. Here we propose a tractable
               model of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of
               allele frequencies that is closely related to the diffusion
               approximation but avoids many of its limitations and
               approximations. We show that the approach is typically faster,
               more numerically stable, and more easily generalizable than the
               state-of-the-art software implementation of the diffusion
               approximation. We present a number of applications to human
               sequence data, including demographic inference with a
               five-population joint frequency spectrum and a discussion of the
               robustness of the out-of-Africa model inference to the choice of
               modern population.",
